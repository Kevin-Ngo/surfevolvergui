# README for *GUI for Surface Evolver* Developers
(Yes, I am talking to you, most likely - NCN URE Student!)

**Use subversion! (NCN URE Student)** It is similar to GitHub (allows you to control versions and is also a safe place to back-up your code), but incase you are not familiar with it, read up on this link on how to use it https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/04/svn-command-examples/

## A Quick Rappture Overview
When you start developing with Rappture, you'll see that it is all ran on the Linux Bash.
**Commands**:
1. "rappture" - runs the "tool.xml" file that is in the current directory.
2. "rappture -builder" - opens up the "tool.xml" file, but in "building" mode. This is useful for adding features on to the GUI. *Note: When you exit the builder, **__DO NOT CHECK THE BOX TO SAVE THE \*.PY FILE, THIS WILL OVERRIDE THE MAIN.PY__**
