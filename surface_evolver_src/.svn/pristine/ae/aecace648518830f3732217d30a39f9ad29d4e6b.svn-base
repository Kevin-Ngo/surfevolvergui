<p class="p1">The Surface Evolver GUI, not to be confused with the <i>Surface Evolver</i>, is a tool that uses the <i>Surface Evolver</i> to  simulate the growth of polycrystalline grains in two dimensions. 
<p class="p2">
Polycrystalline grain boundaries have surface energies associated with boundary curvature and misorientation between abutting grains. These act as the driving force for microstructure evolution.

</p>
The Surface Evolver GUI  runs the simulation using the <i>Surface Evolver</i> and evolves surfaces based on the edited parameters such as: grain boundary Wulff energy, number of grains, number of iterations and color.</p>
<p class="p1">This tool currently supports simulating growth for: Isotropic grains (grains with equal tension at each edge, 3 orientations), mm4-cos grains (grains with varying tension at each edge due to Wulff energies, 3 orientations), and mm4-octagon grains (grains with varying tension at each edge due to Wulff energies, 3 orientations).</p><p class="p1"><strong>To use the tool</strong> - edit the options listed below such as: how many grains to generate using a Voronoi distrubution, how long to simulate the growth (iterations of "g" - a time-step in the <i>Surface Evolver</i>), and to enable color or not for images, then press the simulate button.</p><p class="p1"><img src="grainBeforeEx.png" width="123" height="123">                                <img src="grainAfterEx.png" width="123" height="123"></p>
<p class="p1">The <i>Surface Evolver</i> is a program written by Ken Brakke and can be found <a href="http://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.html">here</a>.</p>
